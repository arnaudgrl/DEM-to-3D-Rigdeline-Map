# DEM to Laser Cut 3D Ridgeline Map
This repository provides resources for anyone to create a wooden representation of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In this instance, I have crafted a wooden sculpture representing the entire Haute-Savoie department. The main idea comes from the following tutorial by  deelstradesigns : https://www.instructables.com/Laser-Cut-3D-Ridgeline-Map/
The main purpose of this repository is to provides an easy and simpler way to realise a Laser Cut 3D Ridgeline Map.
